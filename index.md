# Doing RFC2136 compliant updates of DNS zones using dyndns style http calls. (aka Dynamic DNS)


This project is work in progess. Please be patient.

This project provides a PHP Script to enable routers and other machines to update their DNS records on a RFC2136 compliant dns server by using an dyndns compatible client.

For a quick start please see the README on the [project main site][http2nsupdate].

I will publish the more in depth [documentation on this site][docs]. More to come.
